* GenABEL.data
  GenABEL.data is an R package containing the data files used by the
  GenABEL package.

  On January 21st, 2022 the source code of GenABEL.data was migrated
  from Subversion to Git. This means that the code in the [[https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/GenABEL.data/?root=genabel][GenABEL
  R-Forge repository]] is no longer the canonical source of this
  project. The canonical GenABEL source code can now be found on [[https://github.com/GenABEL-Project/GenABEL.data][the
  GenABEL Github page]] of [[https://github.com/GenABEL-Project][the GenABEL project]].
** IMPORTANT NOTICE
   Early 2018, PolyOmica, the main sponsor of the GenABEL project
   announced that it would discontinue its support. As PolyOmica was
   our only sponsor, we regretfully had to announce the
   discontinuation of the GenABEL Project.
